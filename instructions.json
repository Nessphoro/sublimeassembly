The AAD instruction is only useful when it precedes a DIV instruction that divides (binary division) the adjusted value in the AX register by an unpacked BCD value.\nThe AAD instruction sets the value in the AL register to (AL + (10 * AH)), and then clears the AH register to 00H. The value in the AX register is then equal to the binary equivalent of the original unpacked two-digit (base 10) number in registers AH and AL.\nThe generalized version of this instruction allows adjustment of two unpacked digits of any number base (see the “Operation” section below), by setting the imm8 byte to the selected number base (for example, 08H for octal, 0AH for decimal, or 0CH for base 12 numbers). The AAD mnemonic is interpreted by all assemblers to mean adjust ASCII (base 10) values. To adjust values in another number base, the instruction must be hand coded in machine code (D5 imm8).\nThis instruction executes as described in compatibility mode and legacy mode.

At the beginning of a chain of additions, we need to make sure the CF is in a desired initial state.

If the RPL field of the destination operand is less than the RPL field of the source operand, the ZF flag is set and the RPL field of the destination operand is increased to match that of the source operand. Otherwise, the ZF flag is cleared and no change is made to the destination operand. (The destination operand can be a word register or a memory location; the source operand must be a word register.)\nThe ARPL instruction is provided for use by operating-system procedures (however, it can also be used by applica-tions). It is generally used to adjust the RPL of a segment selector that has been passed to the operating system by an application program to match the privilege level of the application program. Here the segment selector passed to the operating system is placed in the destination operand and segment selector for the application program’s code segment is placed in the source operand. (The RPL field in the source operand represents the priv-ilege level of the application program.) Execution of the ARPL instruction then ensures that the RPL of the segment selector received by the operating system is no lower (does not have a higher privilege) than the privilege level of the application program (the segment selector for the application program’s code segment can be read from the stack following a procedure call).\nThis instruction executes as described in compatibility mode and legacy mode.

    "Name": "CALL",
    "Alias": [],
    "Brief": "Call Procedure",
    "Description": "\nSaves procedure linking information on the stack and branches to the called procedure specified using the target operand. The target operand specifies the address of the first instruction in the called procedure. The operand can be an immediate value, a general-purpose register, or a memory location.\nThis instruction can be used to execute four types of calls:\nThe latter two call types (inter-privilege-level call and task switch) can only be executed in protected mode. See “Calling Procedures Using Call and RET” in Chapter 6 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Devel-oper’s Manual, Volume 1, for additional information on near, far, and inter-privilege-level calls. See Chapter 7, “Task Management,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A, for infor-mation on performing task switches with the CALL instruction.\nNear Call. When executing a near call, the processor pushes the value of the EIP register (which contains the offset of the instruction following the CALL instruction) on the stack (for use later as a return-instruction pointer). The processor then branches to the address in the current code segment specified by the target operand. The target operand specifies either an absolute offset in the code segment (an offset from the base of the code segment) or a relative offset (a signed displacement relative to the current value of the instruction pointer in the EIP register; this value points to the instruction following the CALL instruction). The CS register is not changed on near calls.\nFor a near call absolute, an absolute offset is specified indirectly in a general-purpose register or a memory location (r/m16, r/m32, or r/m64). The operand-size attribute determines the size of the target operand (16, 32 or 64 bits). When in 64-bit mode, the operand size for near call (and all near branches) is forced to 64-bits. Absolute offsets are loaded directly into the EIP(RIP) register. If the operand size attribute is 16, the upper two bytes of the EIP register are cleared, resulting in a maximum instruction pointer size of 16 bits. When accessing an absolute offset indirectly using the stack pointer [ESP] as the base register, the base value used is the value of the ESP before the instruction executes.\nA relative offset (rel16 or rel32) is generally specified as a label in assembly code. But at the machine code level, it is encoded as a signed, 16- or 32-bit immediate value. This value is added to the value in the EIP(RIP) register. In 64-bit mode the relative offset is always a 32-bit immediate value which is sign extended to 64-bits before it is added to the value in the RIP register for the target calculation. As with absolute offsets, the operand-size attribute determines the size of the target operand (16, 32, or 64 bits). In 64-bit mode the target operand will always be 64-bits because the operand size is forced to 64-bits for near branches.\nFar Calls in Real-Address or Virtual-8086 Mode. When executing a far call in real- address or virtual-8086 mode, the processor pushes the current value of both the CS and EIP registers on the stack for use as a return-instruction pointer. The processor then performs a “far branch” to the code segment and offset specified with the target operand for the called procedure. The target operand specifies an absolute far address either directly with a pointer (ptr16:16 or ptr16:32) or indirectly with a memory location (m16:16 or m16:32). With the pointer method, the segment and offset of the called procedure is encoded in the instruction using a 4-byte (16-bit operand size) or 6-byte (32-bit operand size) far address immediate. With the indirect method, the target operand specifies a memory location that contains a 4-byte (16-bit operand size) or 6-byte (32-bit operand size) far address. The operand-size attribute determines the size of the offset (16 or 32 bits) in the far address. The far address is loaded directly into the CS and EIP registers. If the operand-size attribute is 16, the upper two bytes of the EIP register are cleared.\nFar Calls in Protected Mode. When the processor is operating in protected mode, the CALL instruction can be used to perform the following types of far calls:\nIn protected mode, the processor always uses the segment selector part of the far address to access the corre-sponding descriptor in the GDT or LDT. The descriptor type (code segment, call gate, task gate, or TSS) and access rights determine the type of call operation to be performed.\nIf the selected descriptor is for a code segment, a far call to a code segment at the same privilege level is performed. (If the selected code segment is at a different privilege level and the code segment is non-conforming, a general-protection exception is generated.) A far call to the same privilege level in protected mode is very similar to one carried out in real-address or virtual-8086 mode. The target operand specifies an absolute far address either directly with a pointer (ptr16:16 or ptr16:32) or indirectly with a memory location (m16:16 or m16:32). The operand- size attribute determines the size of the offset (16 or 32 bits) in the far address. The new code segment selector and its descriptor are loaded into CS register; the offset from the instruction is loaded into the EIP register.\nA call gate (described in the next paragraph) can also be used to perform a far call to a code segment at the same privilege level. Using this mechanism provides an extra level of indirection and is the preferred method of making calls between 16-bit and 32-bit code segments.\nWhen executing an inter-privilege-level far call, the code segment for the procedure being called must be accessed through a call gate. The segment selector specified by the target operand identifies the call gate. The target\noperand can specify the call gate segment selector either directly with a pointer (ptr16:16 or ptr16:32) or indirectly with a memory location (m16:16 or m16:32). The processor obtains the segment selector for the new code segment and the new instruction pointer (offset) from the call gate descriptor. (The offset from the target operand is ignored when a call gate is used.)\nOn inter-privilege-level calls, the processor switches to the stack for the privilege level of the called procedure. The segment selector for the new stack segment is specified in the TSS for the currently running task. The branch to the new code segment occurs after the stack switch. (Note that when using a call gate to perform a far call to a segment at the same privilege level, no stack switch occurs.) On the new stack, the processor pushes the segment selector and stack pointer for the calling procedure’s stack, an optional set of parameters from the calling proce-dures stack, and the segment selector and instruction pointer for the calling procedure’s code segment. (A value in the call gate descriptor determines how many parameters to copy to the new stack.) Finally, the processor branches to the address of the procedure being called within the new code segment.\nExecuting a task switch with the CALL instruction is similar to executing a call through a call gate. The target operand specifies the segment selector of the task gate for the new task activated by the switch (the offset in the target operand is ignored). The task gate in turn points to the TSS for the new task, which contains the segment selectors for the task’s code and stack segments. Note that the TSS also contains the EIP value for the next instruc-tion that was to be executed before the calling task was suspended. This instruction pointer value is loaded into the EIP register to re-start the calling task.\nThe CALL instruction can also specify the segment selector of the TSS directly, which eliminates the indirection of the task gate. See Chapter 7, “Task Management,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A, for information on the mechanics of a task switch.\nWhen you execute at task switch with a CALL instruction, the nested task flag (NT) is set in the EFLAGS register and the new TSS’s previous task link field is loaded with the old task’s TSS selector. Code is expected to suspend this nested task by executing an IRET instruction which, because the NT flag is set, automatically uses the previous task link to return to the calling task. (See “Task Linking” in Chapter 7 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A, for information on nested tasks.) Switching tasks with the CALL instruc-tion differs in this regard from JMP instruction. JMP does not set the NT flag and therefore does not expect an IRET instruction to suspend the task.\nMixing 16-Bit and 32-Bit Calls. When making far calls between 16-bit and 32-bit code segments, use a call gate. If the far call is from a 32-bit code segment to a 16-bit code segment, the call should be made from the first 64 KBytes of the 32-bit code segment. This is because the operand-size attribute of the instruction is set to 16, so only a 16-bit return address offset can be saved. Also, the call should be made using a 16-bit call gate so that 16-bit values can be pushed on the stack. See Chapter 21, “Mixing 16-Bit and 32-Bit Code,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3B, for more information.\nFar Calls in Compatibility Mode. When the processor is operating in compatibility mode, the CALL instruction can be used to perform the following types of far calls:\nNote that a CALL instruction can not be used to cause a task switch in compatibility mode since task switches are not supported in IA-32e mode.\nIn compatibility mode, the processor always uses the segment selector part of the far address to access the corre-sponding descriptor in the GDT or LDT. The descriptor type (code segment, call gate) and access rights determine the type of call operation to be performed.\nIf the selected descriptor is for a code segment, a far call to a code segment at the same privilege level is performed. (If the selected code segment is at a different privilege level and the code segment is non-conforming, a general-protection exception is generated.) A far call to the same privilege level in compatibility mode is very similar to one carried out in protected mode. The target operand specifies an absolute far address either directly with a pointer (ptr16:16 or ptr16:32) or indirectly with a memory location (m16:16 or m16:32). The operand-size attribute determines the size of the offset (16 or 32 bits) in the far address. The new code segment selector and its descriptor are loaded into CS register and the offset from the instruction is loaded into the EIP register. The differ-ence is that 64-bit mode may be entered. This specified by the L bit in the new code segment descriptor.\nNote that a 64-bit call gate (described in the next paragraph) can also be used to perform a far call to a code segment at the same privilege level. However, using this mechanism requires that the target code segment descriptor have the L bit set, causing an entry to 64-bit mode.\nWhen executing an inter-privilege-level far call, the code segment for the procedure being called must be accessed through a 64-bit call gate. The segment selector specified by the target operand identifies the call gate. The target operand can specify the call gate segment selector either directly with a pointer (ptr16:16 or ptr16:32) or indirectly with a memory location (m16:16 or m16:32). The processor obtains the segment selector for the new code segment and the new instruction pointer (offset) from the 16-byte call gate descriptor. (The offset from the target operand is ignored when a call gate is used.)\nOn inter-privilege-level calls, the processor switches to the stack for the privilege level of the called procedure. The segment selector for the new stack segment is set to NULL. The new stack pointer is specified in the TSS for the currently running task. The branch to the new code segment occurs after the stack switch. (Note that when using a call gate to perform a far call to a segment at the same privilege level, an implicit stack switch occurs as a result of entering 64-bit mode. The SS selector is unchanged, but stack segment accesses use a segment base of 0x0, the limit is ignored, and the default stack size is 64-bits. The full value of RSP is used for the offset, of which the upper 32-bits are undefined.) On the new stack, the processor pushes the segment selector and stack pointer for the calling procedure’s stack and the segment selector and instruction pointer for the calling procedure’s code segment. (Parameter copy is not supported in IA-32e mode.) Finally, the processor branches to the address of the procedure being called within the new code segment.\nNear/(Far) Calls in 64-bit Mode. When the processor is operating in 64-bit mode, the CALL instruction can be used to perform the following types of far calls:\nNote that in this mode the CALL instruction can not be used to cause a task switch in 64-bit mode since task switches are not supported in IA-32e mode.\nIn 64-bit mode, the processor always uses the segment selector part of the far address to access the corresponding descriptor in the GDT or LDT. The descriptor type (code segment, call gate) and access rights determine the type of call operation to be performed.\nIf the selected descriptor is for a code segment, a far call to a code segment at the same privilege level is performed. (If the selected code segment is at a different privilege level and the code segment is non-conforming, a general-protection exception is generated.) A far call to the same privilege level in 64-bit mode is very similar to one carried out in compatibility mode. The target operand specifies an absolute far address indirectly with a memory location (m16:16, m16:32 or m16:64). The form of CALL with a direct specification of absolute far address is not defined in 64-bit mode. The operand-size attribute determines the size of the offset (16, 32, or 64 bits) in the far address. The new code segment selector and its descriptor are loaded into the CS register; the offset from the instruction is loaded into the EIP register. The new code segment may specify entry either into compati-bility or 64-bit mode, based on the L bit value.\nA 64-bit call gate (described in the next paragraph) can also be used to perform a far call to a code segment at the same privilege level. However, using this mechanism requires that the target code segment descriptor have the L bit set.\nWhen executing an inter-privilege-level far call, the code segment for the procedure being called must be accessed through a 64-bit call gate. The segment selector specified by the target operand identifies the call gate. The target operand can only specify the call gate segment selector indirectly with a memory location (m16:16, m16:32 or m16:64). The processor obtains the segment selector for the new code segment and the new instruction pointer (offset) from the 16-byte call gate descriptor. (The offset from the target operand is ignored when a call gate is used.)\nOn inter-privilege-level calls, the processor switches to the stack for the privilege level of the called procedure. The segment selector for the new stack segment is set to NULL. The new stack pointer is specified in the TSS for the currently running task.

The invalidation is broadcast throughout the cache coherence domain. If, at any level of the cache hierarchy, the line is inconsistent with memory (dirty) it is written to memory before invalidation. The source operand is a byte memory location.\nThe availability of CLFLUSH is indicated by the presence of the CPUID feature flag CLFSH (bit 19 of the EDX register, see “CPUID—CPU Identification” in this chapter). The aligned cache line size affected is also indicated with the CPUID instruction (bits 8 through 15 of the EBX register when the initial value in the EAX register is 1).\nThe memory attribute of the page containing the affected line has no effect on the behavior of this instruction. It should be noted that processors are free to speculatively fetch and cache data from system memory regions assigned a memory-type allowing for speculative reads (such as, the WB, WC, and WT memory types). PREFETCHh instructions can be used to provide the processor with hints for this speculative behavior. Because this speculative fetching can occur at any time and is not tied to instruction execution, the CLFLUSH instruction is not ordered with respect to PREFETCHh instructions or any of the speculative fetching mechanisms (that is, data can be specula-tively loaded into a cache line just before, during, or after the execution of a CLFLUSH instruction that references the cache line).\nCLFLUSH is only ordered by the MFENCE instruction. It is not guaranteed to be ordered by any other fencing or seri-alizing instructions or by another CLFLUSH instruction. For example, software can use an MFENCE instruction to ensure that previous stores are included in the write-back.\nThe CLFLUSH instruction can be used at all privilege levels and is subject to all permission checking and faults asso-ciated with a byte load (and in addition, a CLFLUSH instruction is allowed to flush a linear address in an execute-only segment). Like a load, the CLFLUSH instruction sets the A bit but not the D bit in the page tables.\nThe CLFLUSH instruction was introduced with the SSE2 extensions; however, because it has its own CPUID feature flag, it can be implemented in IA-32 processors that do not include the SSE2 extensions. Also, detecting the pres-ence of the SSE2 extensions with the CPUID instruction does not guarantee that the CLFLUSH instruction is imple-mented in the processor.\nCLFLUSH operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.\n"

A condition code (cc) is associated with each instruction to indicate the condition being tested for. If the condition is not satisfied, a move is not performed and execution continues with the instruction following the CMOVcc instruction.\nThese instructions can move 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit values from memory to a general-purpose register or from one general-purpose register to another. Conditional moves of 8-bit register operands are not supported.\nThe condition for each CMOVcc mnemonic is given in the description column of the above table. The terms “less” and “greater” are used for comparisons of signed integers and the terms “above” and “below” are used for unsigned integers.\nBecause a particular state of the status flags can sometimes be interpreted in two ways, two mnemonics are defined for some opcodes. For example, the CMOVA (conditional move if above) instruction and the CMOVNBE (conditional move if not below or equal) instruction are alternate mnemonics for the opcode 0F 47H.\nThe CMOVcc instructions were introduced in P6 family processors; however, these instructions may not be supported by all IA-32 processors.

    "Description": "\nPerforms a SIMD compare of the packed single-precision floating-point values in the source operand (second operand) and the destination operand (first operand) and returns the results of the comparison to the destination operand. The comparison predicate operand (third operand) specifies the type of comparison performed on each of the pairs of packed values. The result of each comparison is a doubleword mask of all 1s (comparison true) or all 0s (comparison false). The sign of zero is ignored for comparisons, so that –0.0 is equal to +0.0.\n128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source and destination operand (first operand) is an XMM register. The second source operand (second operand) can be an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The comparison predicate operand is an 8-bit immediate, bits 2:0 of the immediate define the type of comparison to be performed (see Table 3-7). Bits 7:3 of the immediate is reserved. Bits (VLMAX-1:128) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged. Four comparisons are performed with results written to bits 127:0 of the destination operand.\nThe unordered relationship is true when at least one of the two source operands being compared is a NaN; the ordered relationship is true when neither source operand is a NaN.\nA subsequent computational instruction that uses the mask result in the destination operand as an input operand will not generate a fault, because a mask of all 0s corresponds to a floating-point value of +0.0 and a mask of all 1s corresponds to a QNaN.\nNote that processors with “CPUID.1H:ECX.AVX =0” do not implement the “greater-than”, “greater-than-or-equal”, “not-greater than”, and “not-greater-than-or-equal relations” predicates. These comparisons can be made either by using the inverse relationship (that is, use the “not-less-than-or-equal” to make a “greater-than” comparison) or by using software emulation. When using software emulation, the program must swap the operands (copying registers when necessary to protect the data that will now be in the destination), and then perform the compare using a different predicate. The predicate to be used for these emulations is listed in Table 3-7 under the heading Emulation.\nCompilers and assemblers may implement the following two-operand pseudo-ops in addition to the three-operand CMPPS instruction, for processors with “CPUID.1H:ECX.AVX =0”. See Table 3-11.

    "Description": "\nCompares the byte, word, doubleword, or quadword specified with the first source operand with the byte, word, doubleword, or quadword specified with the second source operand and sets the status flags in the EFLAGS register according to the results.\nBoth source operands are located in memory. The address of the first source operand is read from DS:SI, DS:ESI or RSI (depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction is 16, 32, or 64, respectively). The address of the second source operand is read from ES:DI, ES:EDI or RDI (again depending on the address-size attribute of the\ninstruction is 16, 32, or 64). The DS segment may be overridden with a segment override prefix, but the ES segment cannot be overridden.\nAt the assembly-code level, two forms of this instruction are allowed: the “explicit-operands” form and the “no-operands” form. The explicit-operands form (specified with the CMPS mnemonic) allows the two source operands to be specified explicitly. Here, the source operands should be symbols that indicate the size and location of the source values. This explicit-operand form is provided to allow documentation. However, note that the documenta-tion provided by this form can be misleading. That is, the source operand symbols must specify the correct type (size) of the operands (bytes, words, or doublewords, quadwords), but they do not have to specify the correct loca-tion. Locations of the source operands are always specified by the DS:(E)SI (or RSI) and ES:(E)DI (or RDI) regis-ters, which must be loaded correctly before the compare string instruction is executed.\nThe no-operands form provides “short forms” of the byte, word, and doubleword versions of the CMPS instructions. Here also the DS:(E)SI (or RSI) and ES:(E)DI (or RDI) registers are assumed by the processor to specify the loca-tion of the source operands. The size of the source operands is selected with the mnemonic: CMPSB (byte compar-ison), CMPSW (word comparison), CMPSD (doubleword comparison), or CMPSQ (quadword comparison using REX.W).\nAfter the comparison, the (E/R)SI and (E/R)DI registers increment or decrement automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. (If the DF flag is 0, the (E/R)SI and (E/R)DI register increment; if the DF flag is 1, the registers decrement.) The registers increment or decrement by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word operations, 4 for doubleword operations. If operand size is 64, RSI and RDI registers increment by 8 for quadword operations.\nThe CMPS, CMPSB, CMPSW, CMPSD, and CMPSQ instructions can be preceded by the REP prefix for block compar-isons. More often, however, these instructions will be used in a LOOP construct that takes some action based on the setting of the status flags before the next comparison is made. See “REP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ—Repeat String Operation Prefix” in Chapter 4 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2B, for a description of the REP prefix.\nIn 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default address size is 64 bits, 32 bit address size is supported using the prefix 67H. Use of the REX.W prefix promotes doubleword operation to 64 bits (see CMPSQ). See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.\n"

    "Description": "\nThe ID flag (bit 21) in the EFLAGS register indicates support for the CPUID instruction. If a software procedure can set and clear this flag, the processor executing the procedure supports the CPUID instruction. This instruction oper-ates the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.\nCPUID returns processor identification and feature information in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers.1 The instruction’s output is dependent on the contents of the EAX register upon execution (in some cases, ECX as well). For example, the following pseudocode loads EAX with 00H and causes CPUID to return a Maximum Return Value and the Vendor Identification String in the appropriate registers:\nMOV EAX, 00H\nCPUID\nTable 3-17 shows information returned, depending on the initial value loaded into the EAX register. Table 3-18 shows the maximum CPUID input value recognized for each family of IA-32 processors on which CPUID is imple-mented.\nTwo types of information are returned: basic and extended function information. If a value entered for CPUID.EAX is higher than the maximum input value for basic or extended function for that processor then the data for the highest basic information leaf is returned. For example, using the Intel Core i7 processor, the following is true:\nCPUID.EAX = 05H (* Returns MONITOR/MWAIT leaf. *)\nCPUID.EAX = 0AH (* Returns Architectural Performance Monitoring leaf. *)\nCPUID.EAX = 0BH (* Returns Extended Topology Enumeration leaf. *)\nCPUID.EAX = 0CH (* INVALID: Returns the same information as CPUID.EAX = 0BH. *)\nCPUID.EAX = 80000008H (* Returns linear/physical address size data. *)\nCPUID.EAX = 8000000AH (* INVALID: Returns same information as CPUID.EAX = 0BH. *)\nIf a value entered for CPUID.EAX is less than or equal to the maximum input value and the leaf is not supported on that processor then 0 is returned in all the registers. For example, using the Intel Core i7 processor, the following is true:\nCPUID.EAX = 07H (*Returns EAX=EBX=ECX=EDX=0. *)\nWhen CPUID returns the highest basic leaf information as a result of an invalid input EAX value, any dependence on input ECX value in the basic leaf is honored.\nCPUID can be executed at any privilege level to serialize instruction execution. Serializing instruction execution guarantees that any modifications to flags, registers, and memory for previous instructions are completed before the next instruction is fetched and executed.\nSee also:\n“Serializing Instructions” in Chapter 8, “Multiple-Processor Management,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.\n1.\nOn Intel 64 processors, CPUID clears the high 32 bits of the RAX/RBX/RCX/RDX registers in all modes.\n“Caching Translation Information” in Chapter 4, “Paging,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Devel-oper’s Manual, Volume 3A.\nTable 3-17.

    "Description": "\nStarting with an initial value in the first operand (destination operand), accumulates a CRC32 (polynomial 11EDC6F41H) value for the second operand (source operand) and stores the result in the destination operand. The source operand can be a register or a memory location. The destination operand must be an r32 or r64 register. If the destination is an r64 register, then the 32-bit result is stored in the least significant double word and 00000000H is stored in the most significant double word of the r64 register.\nThe initial value supplied in the destination operand is a double word integer stored in the r32 register or the least significant double word of the r64 register. To incrementally accumulate a CRC32 value, software retains the result of the previous CRC32 operation in the destination operand, then executes the CRC32 instruction again with new input data in the source operand. Data contained in the source operand is processed in reflected bit order. This means that the most significant bit of the source operand is treated as the least significant bit of the quotient, and so on, for all the bits of the source operand. Likewise, the result of the CRC operation is stored in the destination operand in reflected bit order. This means that the most significant bit of the resulting CRC (bit 31) is stored in the least significant bit of the destination operand (bit 0), and so on, for all the bits of the CRC.\n"

    "Description": "\nCreates a stack frame for a procedure. The first operand (size operand) specifies the size of the stack frame (that is, the number of bytes of dynamic storage allocated on the stack for the procedure). The second operand (nesting level operand) gives the lexical nesting level (0 to 31) of the procedure. The nesting level determines the number of stack frame pointers that are copied into the “display area” of the new stack frame from the preceding frame. Both of these operands are immediate values.\nThe stack-size attribute determines whether the BP (16 bits), EBP (32 bits), or RBP (64 bits) register specifies the current frame pointer and whether SP (16 bits), ESP (32 bits), or RSP (64 bits) specifies the stack pointer. In 64-bit mode, stack-size attribute is always 64-bits.\nThe ENTER and companion LEAVE instructions are provided to support block structured languages. The ENTER instruction (when used) is typically the first instruction in a procedure and is used to set up a new stack frame for a procedure. The LEAVE instruction is then used at the end of the procedure (just before the RET instruction) to release the stack frame.\nIf the nesting level is 0, the processor pushes the frame pointer from the BP/EBP/RBP register onto the stack, copies the current stack pointer from the SP/ESP/RSP register into the BP/EBP/RBP register, and loads the SP/ESP/RSP register with the current stack-pointer value minus the value in the size operand. For nesting levels of 1 or greater, the processor pushes additional frame pointers on the stack before adjusting the stack pointer. These additional frame pointers provide the called procedure with access points to other nested frames on the stack. See “Procedure Calls for Block-Structured Languages” in Chapter 6 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information about the actions of the ENTER instruction.\nThe ENTER instruction causes a page fault whenever a write using the final value of the stack pointer (within the current stack segment) would do so.\nIn 64-bit mode, default operation size is 64 bits; 32-bit operation size cannot be encoded.\n"

Following this operation, the new top-of-stack register ST(0) contains the value of the original significand expressed as a floating-point value. The sign and significand of this value are the same as those found in the source operand, and the exponent is 3FFFH (biased value for a true expo-nent of zero). The ST(1) register contains the value of the original operand’s true (unbiased) exponent expressed as a floating-point value. (The operation performed by this instruction is a superset of the IEEE-recommended logb(x) function.)\nThis instruction and the F2XM1 instruction are useful for performing power and range scaling operations. The FXTRACT instruction is also useful for converting numbers in double extended-precision floating-point format to decimal representations (e.g., for printing or displaying).\nIf the floating-point zero-divide exception (#Z) is masked and the source operand is zero, an exponent value of – ∞ is stored in register ST(1) and 0 with the sign of the source operand is stored in register ST(0).\nThis instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.\n"

The source operand is an I/O port address (from 0 to 65,535) that is read from the DX register. The destination operand is a memory location, the address of which is read from either the ES:DI, ES:EDI or the RDI registers (depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction, 16, 32 or 64, respectively). (The ES segment cannot be overridden with a segment override prefix.) The size of the I/O port being accessed (that is, the size of the source and destination operands) is determined by the opcode for an 8-bit I/O port or by the operand-size attri-bute of the instruction for a 16- or 32-bit I/O port.\nAt the assembly-code level, two forms of this instruction are allowed: the “explicit-operands” form and the “no-operands” form. The explicit-operands form (specified with the INS mnemonic) allows the source and destination operands to be specified explicitly. Here, the source operand must be “DX,” and the destination operand should be a symbol that indicates the size of the I/O port and the destination address. This explicit-operands form is provided to allow documentation; however, note that the documentation provided by this form can be misleading. That is, the destination operand symbol must specify the correct type (size) of the operand (byte, word, or doubleword), but it does not have to specify the correct location. The location is always specified by the ES:(E)DI registers, which must be loaded correctly before the INS instruction is executed.\nThe no-operands form provides “short forms” of the byte, word, and doubleword versions of the INS instructions. Here also DX is assumed by the processor to be the source operand and ES:(E)DI is assumed to be the destination operand. The size of the I/O port is specified with the choice of mnemonic: INSB (byte), INSW (word), or INSD (doubleword).\nAfter the byte, word, or doubleword is transfer from the I/O port to the memory location, the DI/EDI/RDI register is incremented or decremented automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. (If the DF flag is 0, the (E)DI register is incremented; if the DF flag is 1, the (E)DI register is decremented.) The (E)DI register is incremented or decremented by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word operations, or by 4 for doubleword operations.\nThe INS, INSB, INSW, and INSD instructions can be preceded by the REP prefix for block input of ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. See “REP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ—Repeat String Operation Prefix” in Chapter 4 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2B, for a description of the REP prefix.\nThese instructions are only useful for accessing I/O ports located in the processor’s I/O address space.

    "Description": "\nThe INT n instruction generates a call to the interrupt or exception handler specified with the destination operand (see the section titled “Interrupts and Exceptions” in Chapter 6 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1). The destination operand specifies a vector from 0 to 255, encoded as an 8-bit unsigned intermediate value. Each vector provides an index to a gate descriptor in the IDT. The first 32 vectors are reserved by Intel for system use. Some of these vectors are used for internally generated exceptions.\nThe INT n instruction is the general mnemonic for executing a software-generated call to an interrupt handler. The INTO instruction is a special mnemonic for calling overflow exception (#OF), exception 4. The overflow interrupt checks the OF flag in the EFLAGS register and calls the overflow interrupt handler if the OF flag is set to 1. (The INTO instruction cannot be used in 64-bit mode.)\nThe INT 3 instruction generates a special one byte opcode (CC) that is intended for calling the debug exception handler. (This one byte form is valuable because it can be used to replace the first byte of any instruction with a breakpoint, including other one byte instructions, without over-writing other code). To further support its function as a debug breakpoint, the interrupt generated with the CC opcode also differs from the regular software interrupts as follows:\nNote that the “normal” 2-byte opcode for INT 3 (CD03) does not have these special features. Intel and Microsoft assemblers will not generate the CD03 opcode from any mnemonic, but this opcode can be created by direct numeric code definition or by self-modifying code.\nThe action of the INT n instruction (including the INTO and INT 3 instructions) is similar to that of a far call made with the CALL instruction. The primary difference is that with the INT n instruction, the EFLAGS register is pushed onto the stack before the return address. (The return address is a far address consisting of the current values of the CS and EIP registers.) Returns from interrupt procedures are handled with the IRET instruction, which pops the EFLAGS information and return address from the stack.\nThe vector specifies an interrupt descriptor in the interrupt descriptor table (IDT); that is, it provides index into the IDT. The selected interrupt descriptor in turn contains a pointer to an interrupt or exception handler procedure. In protected mode, the IDT contains an array of 8-byte descriptors, each of which is an interrupt gate, trap gate, or task gate. In real-address mode, the IDT is an array of 4-byte far pointers (2-byte code segment selector and a 2-byte instruction pointer), each of which point directly to a procedure in the selected segment. (Note that in real-address mode, the IDT is called the interrupt vector table, and its pointers are called interrupt vectors.)\nThe following decision table indicates which action in the lower portion of the table is taken given the conditions in the upper portion of the table.

It is the responsibility of hardware to respond to the cache flush signal.\nThe INVD instruction is a privileged instruction. When the processor is running in protected mode, the CPL of a program or procedure must be 0 to execute this instruction.\nThe INVD instruction may be used when the cache is used as temporary memory and the cache contents need to be invalidated rather than written back to memory. When the cache is used as temporary memory, no external device should be actively writing data to main memory.\nUse this instruction with care. Data cached internally and not written back to main memory will be lost. Note that any data from an external device to main memory (for example, via a PCIWrite) can be temporarily stored in the caches; these data can be lost when an INVD instruction is executed. Unless there is a specific requirement or benefit to flushing caches without writing back modified cache lines (for example, temporary memory, testing, or fault recovery where cache coherency with main memory is not a concern), software should instead use the WBINVD instruction.\nThis instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.\n"

    "Brief": "Interrupt Return",
    "Description": "\nReturns program control from an exception or interrupt handler to a program or procedure that was interrupted by an exception, an external interrupt, or a software-generated interrupt. These instructions are also used to perform a return from a nested task. (A nested task is created when a CALL instruction is used to initiate a task switch or when an interrupt or exception causes a task switch to an interrupt or exception handler.) See the section titled “Task Linking” in Chapter 7 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.\nIRET and IRETD are mnemonics for the same opcode. The IRETD mnemonic (interrupt return double) is intended for use when returning from an interrupt when using the 32-bit operand size; however, most assemblers use the IRET mnemonic interchangeably for both operand sizes.\nIn Real-Address Mode, the IRET instruction preforms a far return to the interrupted program or procedure. During this operation, the processor pops the return instruction pointer, return code segment selector, and EFLAGS image from the stack to the EIP, CS, and EFLAGS registers, respectively, and then resumes execution of the interrupted program or procedure.\nIn Protected Mode, the action of the IRET instruction depends on the settings of the NT (nested task) and VM flags in the EFLAGS register and the VM flag in the EFLAGS image stored on the current stack. Depending on the setting of these flags, the processor performs the following types of interrupt returns:\nIf the NT flag (EFLAGS register) is cleared, the IRET instruction performs a far return from the interrupt procedure, without a task switch. The code segment being returned to must be equally or less privileged than the interrupt handler routine (as indicated by the RPL field of the code segment selector popped from the stack).\nAs with a real-address mode interrupt return, the IRET instruction pops the return instruction pointer, return code segment selector, and EFLAGS image from the stack to the EIP, CS, and EFLAGS registers, respectively, and then resumes execution of the interrupted program or procedure. If the return is to another privilege level, the IRET instruction also pops the stack pointer and SS from the stack, before resuming program execution. If the return is to virtual-8086 mode, the processor also pops the data segment registers from the stack.\nIf the NT flag is set, the IRET instruction performs a task switch (return) from a nested task (a task called with a CALL instruction, an interrupt, or an exception) back to the calling or interrupted task. The updated state of the task executing the IRET instruction is saved in its TSS. If the task is re-entered later, the code that follows the IRET instruction is executed.\nIf the NT flag is set and the processor is in IA-32e mode, the IRET instruction causes a general protection excep-tion.\nIf nonmaskable interrupts (NMIs) are blocked (see Section 6.7.1, “Handling Multiple NMIs” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A), execution of the IRET instruction unblocks NMIs.\nThis unblocking occurs even if the instruction causes a fault. In such a case, NMIs are unmasked before the excep-tion handler is invoked.\nIn 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits (IRETQ). See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.\nSee “Changes to Instruction Behavior in VMX Non-Root Operation” in Chapter 25 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Archi-tectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3C, for more information about the behavior of this instruction in VMX non-root operation.\n"

    "Name": "JMP",
    "Alias": [],
    "Brief": "Jump",
    "Description": "\nTransfers program control to a different point in the instruction stream without recording return information. The destination (target) operand specifies the address of the instruction being jumped to. This operand can be an immediate value, a general-purpose register, or a memory location.\nThis instruction can be used to execute four different types of jumps:\nA task switch can only be executed in protected mode (see Chapter 7, in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A, for information on performing task switches with the JMP instruction).\nNear and Short Jumps. When executing a near jump, the processor jumps to the address (within the current code segment) that is specified with the target operand. The target operand specifies either an absolute offset (that is an offset from the base of the code segment) or a relative offset (a signed displacement relative to the current\nvalue of the instruction pointer in the EIP register). A near jump to a relative offset of 8-bits (rel8) is referred to as a short jump. The CS register is not changed on near and short jumps.\nAn absolute offset is specified indirectly in a general-purpose register or a memory location (r/m16 or r/m32). The operand-size attribute determines the size of the target operand (16 or 32 bits). Absolute offsets are loaded directly into the EIP register. If the operand-size attribute is 16, the upper two bytes of the EIP register are cleared, resulting in a maximum instruction pointer size of 16 bits.\nA relative offset (rel8, rel16, or rel32) is generally specified as a label in assembly code, but at the machine code level, it is encoded as a signed 8-, 16-, or 32-bit immediate value. This value is added to the value in the EIP register. (Here, the EIP register contains the address of the instruction following the JMP instruction). When using relative offsets, the opcode (for short vs. near jumps) and the operand-size attribute (for near relative jumps) determines the size of the target operand (8, 16, or 32 bits).\nFar Jumps in Real-Address or Virtual-8086 Mode. When executing a far jump in real-address or virtual-8086 mode, the processor jumps to the code segment and offset specified with the target operand. Here the target operand specifies an absolute far address either directly with a pointer (ptr16:16 or ptr16:32) or indirectly with a memory location (m16:16 or m16:32). With the pointer method, the segment and address of the called procedure is encoded in the instruction, using a 4-byte (16-bit operand size) or 6-byte (32-bit operand size) far address imme-diate. With the indirect method, the target operand specifies a memory location that contains a 4-byte (16-bit operand size) or 6-byte (32-bit operand size) far address. The far address is loaded directly into the CS and EIP registers. If the operand-size attribute is 16, the upper two bytes of the EIP register are cleared.\nFar Jumps in Protected Mode. When the processor is operating in protected mode, the JMP instruction can be used to perform the following three types of far jumps:\n(The JMP instruction cannot be used to perform inter-privilege-level far jumps.)\nIn protected mode, the processor always uses the segment selector part of the far address to access the corre-sponding descriptor in the GDT or LDT. The descriptor type (code segment, call gate, task gate, or TSS) and access rights determine the type of jump to be performed.\nIf the selected descriptor is for a code segment, a far jump to a code segment at the same privilege level is performed. (If the selected code segment is at a different privilege level and the code segment is non-conforming, a general-protection exception is generated.) A far jump to the same privilege level in protected mode is very similar to one carried out in real-address or virtual-8086 mode. The target operand specifies an absolute far address either directly with a pointer (ptr16:16 or ptr16:32) or indirectly with a memory location (m16:16 or m16:32). The operand-size attribute determines the size of the offset (16 or 32 bits) in the far address. The new code segment selector and its descriptor are loaded into CS register, and the offset from the instruction is loaded into the EIP register. Note that a call gate (described in the next paragraph) can also be used to perform far call to a code segment at the same privilege level. Using this mechanism provides an extra level of indirection and is the preferred method of making jumps between 16-bit and 32-bit code segments.\nWhen executing a far jump through a call gate, the segment selector specified by the target operand identifies the call gate. (The offset part of the target operand is ignored.) The processor then jumps to the code segment speci-fied in the call gate descriptor and begins executing the instruction at the offset specified in the call gate. No stack switch occurs. Here again, the target operand can specify the far address of the call gate either directly with a pointer (ptr16:16 or ptr16:32) or indirectly with a memory location (m16:16 or m16:32).\nExecuting a task switch with the JMP instruction is somewhat similar to executing a jump through a call gate. Here the target operand specifies the segment selector of the task gate for the task being switched to (and the offset part of the target operand is ignored). The task gate in turn points to the TSS for the task, which contains the segment selectors for the task’s code and stack segments. The TSS also contains the EIP value for the next instruc-tion that was to be executed before the task was suspended. This instruction pointer value is loaded into the EIP register so that the task begins executing again at this next instruction.\nThe JMP instruction can also specify the segment selector of the TSS directly, which eliminates the indirection of the task gate. See Chapter 7 in Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A, for detailed information on the mechanics of a task switch.\nNote that when you execute at task switch with a JMP instruction, the nested task flag (NT) is not set in the EFLAGS register and the new TSS’s previous task link field is not loaded with the old task’s TSS selector. A return to the previous task can thus not be carried out by executing the IRET instruction. Switching tasks with the JMP instruc-tion differs in this regard from the CALL instruction which does set the NT flag and save the previous task link infor-mation, allowing a return to the calling task with an IRET instruction.\nIn 64-Bit Mode — The instruction’s operation size is fixed at 64 bits. If a selector points to a gate, then RIP equals the 64-bit displacement taken from gate; else RIP equals the zero-extended offset from the far pointer referenced in the instruction.\nSee the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.\n"

A condition code (cc) is associated with each instruction to indicate the condition being tested for. If the condition is not satisfied, the jump is not performed and execution continues with the instruction following the Jcc instruction.\nThe target instruction is specified with a relative offset (a signed offset relative to the current value of the instruc-tion pointer in the EIP register). A relative offset (rel8, rel16, or rel32) is generally specified as a label in assembly code, but at the machine code level, it is encoded as a signed, 8-bit or 32-bit immediate value, which is added to the instruction pointer. Instruction coding is most efficient for offsets of –128 to +127. If the operand-size attribute is 16, the upper two bytes of the EIP register are cleared, resulting in a maximum instruction pointer size of 16 bits.\nThe conditions for each Jcc mnemonic are given in the “Description” column of the table on the preceding page. The terms “less” and “greater” are used for comparisons of signed integers and the terms “above” and “below” are used for unsigned integers.\nBecause a particular state of the status flags can sometimes be interpreted in two ways, two mnemonics are defined for some opcodes. For example, the JA (jump if above) instruction and the JNBE (jump if not below or equal) instruction are alternate mnemonics for the opcode 77H.\nThe Jcc instruction does not support far jumps (jumps to other code segments). When the target for the conditional jump is in a different segment, use the opposite condition from the condition being tested for the Jcc instruction, and then access the target with an unconditional far jump (JMP instruction) to the other segment. For example, the following conditional far jump is illegal:\nJZ FARLABEL;\nTo accomplish this far jump, use the following two instructions:\nJNZ BEYOND;\nJMP FARLABEL;\nBEYOND:\nThe JRCXZ, JECXZ and JCXZ instructions differ from other Jcc instructions because they do not check status flags. Instead, they check RCX, ECX or CX for 0. The register checked is determined by the address-size attribute. These instructions are useful when used at the beginning of a loop that terminates with a conditional loop instruction (such as LOOPNE). They can be used to prevent an instruction sequence from entering a loop when RCX, ECX or CX is 0. This would cause the loop to execute 264, 232 or 64K times (not zero times).\nAll conditional jumps are converted to code fetches of one or two cache lines, regardless of jump address or cache-ability.\nIn 64-bit mode, operand size is fixed at 64 bits. JMP Short is RIP = RIP + 8-bit offset sign extended to 64 bits. JMP Near is RIP = RIP + 32-bit offset sign extended to 64-bits.\n"

The source operand specifies a 48-bit or a 32-bit pointer in memory depending on the current setting of the operand-size attribute (32 bits or 16 bits, respectively). The instruction opcode and the destination operand specify a segment register/general-purpose register pair. The 16-bit segment selector from the source operand is loaded into the segment register specified with the opcode (DS, SS, ES, FS, or GS). The 32-bit or 16-bit offset is loaded into the register specified with the destination operand.\nIf one of these instructions is executed in protected mode, additional information from the segment descriptor pointed to by the segment selector in the source operand is loaded in the hidden part of the selected segment register.\nAlso in protected mode, a NULL selector (values 0000 through 0003) can be loaded into DS, ES, FS, or GS registers without causing a protection exception. (Any subsequent reference to a segment whose corresponding segment register is loaded with a NULL selector, causes a general-protection exception (#GP) and no memory reference to the segment occurs.)\nIn 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to specify a source operand referencing an 80-bit pointer (16-bit selector, 64-bit offset) in memory. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.\n"

Specifically, LFENCE does not execute until all prior instructions have completed locally, and no later instruc-tion begins execution until LFENCE completes. In particular, an instruction that loads from memory and that precedes an LFENCE receives data from memory prior to completion of the LFENCE. (An LFENCE that follows an instruction that stores to memory might complete before the data being stored have become globally visible.) Instructions following an LFENCE may be fetched from memory before the LFENCE, but they will not execute until the LFENCE completes.\nWeakly ordered memory types can be used to achieve higher processor performance through such techniques as out-of-order issue and speculative reads. The degree to which a consumer of data recognizes or knows that the data is weakly ordered varies among applications and may be unknown to the producer of this data. The LFENCE instruction provides a performance-efficient way of ensuring load ordering between routines that produce weakly-ordered results and routines that consume that data.\nProcessors are free to fetch and cache data speculatively from regions of system memory that use the WB, WC, and WT memory types. This speculative fetching can occur at any time and is not tied to instruction execution. Thus, it is not ordered with respect to executions of the LFENCE instruction; data can be brought into the caches specula-tively just before, during, or after the execution of an LFENCE instruction.\nThis instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.\nSpecification of the instruction's opcode above indicates a ModR/M byte of E8. For this instruction, the processor ignores the r/m field of the ModR/M byte. Thus, LFENCE is encoded by any opcode of the form 0F AE Ex, where x is in the range 8-F.\n"

The source operand is a memory location, the address of which is read from the DS:ESI or the DS:SI registers (depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction, 32 or 16, respectively). The DS segment may be over-ridden with a segment override prefix.\nAt the assembly-code level, two forms of this instruction are allowed: the “explicit-operands” form and the “no-operands” form. The explicit-operands form (specified with the LODS mnemonic) allows the source operand to be specified explicitly. Here, the source operand should be a symbol that indicates the size and location of the source value. The destination operand is then automatically selected to match the size of the source operand (the AL register for byte operands, AX for word operands, and EAX for doubleword operands). This explicit-operands form is provided to allow documentation; however, note that the documentation provided by this form can be misleading. That is, the source operand symbol must specify the correct type (size) of the operand (byte, word, or doubleword), but it does not have to specify the correct location. The location is always specified by the DS:(E)SI registers, which must be loaded correctly before the load string instruction is executed.\nThe no-operands form provides “short forms” of the byte, word, and doubleword versions of the LODS instructions. Here also DS:(E)SI is assumed to be the source operand and the AL, AX, or EAX register is assumed to be the desti-nation operand. The size of the source and destination operands is selected with the mnemonic: LODSB (byte loaded into register AL), LODSW (word loaded into AX), or LODSD (doubleword loaded into EAX).\nAfter the byte, word, or doubleword is transferred from the memory location into the AL, AX, or EAX register, the (E)SI register is incremented or decremented automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. (If the DF flag is 0, the (E)SI register is incremented; if the DF flag is 1, the ESI register is decremented.) The (E)SI register is incremented or decremented by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word operations, or by 4 for doubleword operations.\nIn 64-bit mode, use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits. LODS/LODSQ load the quadword at address (R)SI into RAX. The (R)SI register is then incremented or decremented automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register.\nThe LODS, LODSB, LODSW, and LODSD instructions can be preceded by the REP prefix for block loads of ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. More often, however, these instructions are used within a LOOP construct because further processing of the data moved into the register is  usually necessary before the next transfer can be made.

If the count is 0, the loop is terminated and program execution continues with the instruction following the LOOP instruction. If the count is not zero, a near jump is performed to the destination (target) operand, which is presumably the instruction at the beginning of the loop.\nThe target instruction is specified with a relative offset (a signed offset relative to the current value of the instruc-tion pointer in the IP/EIP/RIP register). This offset is generally specified as a label in assembly code, but at the machine code level, it is encoded as a signed, 8-bit immediate value, which is added to the instruction pointer. Offsets of –128 to +127 are allowed with this instruction.\nSome forms of the loop instruction (LOOPcc) also accept the ZF flag as a condition for terminating the loop before the count reaches zero. With these forms of the instruction, a condition code (cc) is associated with each instruc-tion to indicate the condition being tested for.

The destination operand is a general-purpose register.\nThe processor performs access checks as part of the loading process. Once loaded in the destination register, soft-ware can compare the segment limit with the offset of a pointer.\nThe segment limit is a 20-bit value contained in bytes 0 and 1 and in the first 4 bits of byte 6 of the segment descriptor. If the descriptor has a byte granular segment limit (the granularity flag is set to 0), the destination operand is loaded with a byte granular value (byte limit). If the descriptor has a page granular segment limit (the granularity flag is set to 1), the LSL instruction will translate the page granular limit (page limit) into a byte limit before loading it into the destination operand. The translation is performed by shifting the 20-bit “raw” limit left 12 bits and filling the low-order 12 bits with 1s.\nWhen the operand size is 32 bits, the 32-bit byte limit is stored in the destination operand.

This serializing operation guarantees that every load and store instruction that precedes the MFENCE instruction in program order becomes globally visible before any load or store instruction that follows the MFENCE instruction.1 The MFENCE instruction is ordered with respect to all load and store instructions, other MFENCE instructions, any LFENCE and SFENCE instructions, and any serializing instructions (such as the CPUID instruction). MFENCE does not serialize the instruction stream.\nWeakly ordered memory types can be used to achieve higher processor performance through such techniques as out-of-order issue, speculative reads, write-combining, and write-collapsing. The degree to which a consumer of data recognizes or knows that the data is weakly ordered varies among applications and may be unknown to the producer of this data. The MFENCE instruction provides a performance-efficient way of ensuring load and store ordering between routines that produce weakly-ordered results and routines that consume that data.\nProcessors are free to fetch and cache data speculatively from regions of system memory that use the WB, WC, and WT memory types. This speculative fetching can occur at any time and is not tied to instruction execution. Thus, it is not ordered with respect to executions of the MFENCE instruction; data can be brought into the caches specula-tively just before, during, or after the execution of an MFENCE instruction.\nThis instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.\nSpecification of the instruction's opcode above indicates a ModR/M byte of F0. For this instruction, the processor ignores the r/m field of the ModR/M byte. Thus, MFENCE is encoded by any opcode of the form 0F AE Fx, where x is in the range 0-7.\n"

    "Description": "\nThe MONITOR instruction arms address monitoring hardware using an address specified in EAX (the address range that the monitoring hardware checks for store operations can be determined by using CPUID). A store to an address within the specified address range triggers the monitoring hardware. The state of monitor hardware is used by MWAIT.\nThe content of EAX is an effective address (in 64-bit mode, RAX is used). By default, the DS segment is used to create a linear address that is monitored. Segment overrides can be used.\nECX and EDX are also used. They communicate other information to MONITOR. ECX specifies optional extensions. EDX specifies optional hints; it does not change the architectural behavior of the instruction. For the Pentium 4 processor (family 15, model 3), no extensions or hints are defined. Undefined hints in EDX are ignored by the processor; undefined extensions in ECX raises a general protection fault.\nThe address range must use memory of the write-back type. Only write-back memory will correctly trigger the monitoring hardware. Additional information on determining what address range to use in order to prevent false wake-ups is described in Chapter 8, “Multiple-Processor Management” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.\nThe MONITOR instruction is ordered as a load operation with respect to other memory transactions. The instruction is subject to the permission checking and faults associated with a byte load. Like a load, MONITOR sets the A-bit but not the D-bit in page tables.\nCPUID.01H:ECX.MONITOR[bit 3] indicates the availability of MONITOR and MWAIT in the processor. When set, MONITOR may be executed only at privilege level 0 (use at any other privilege level results in an invalid-opcode exception). The operating system or system BIOS may disable this instruction by using the IA32_MISC_ENABLE MSR; disabling MONITOR clears the CPUID feature flag and causes execution to generate an invalid-opcode excep-tion.\nThe instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.\n"

    "Description": "\nCopies the second operand (source operand) to the first operand (destination operand). The source operand can be an immediate value, general-purpose register, segment register, or memory location; the destination register can be a general-purpose register, segment register, or memory location. Both operands must be the same size, which can be a byte, a word, a doubleword, or a quadword.\nThe MOV instruction cannot be used to load the CS register. Attempting to do so results in an invalid opcode excep-tion (#UD). To load the CS register, use the far JMP, CALL, or RET instruction.\nIf the destination operand is a segment register (DS, ES, FS, GS, or SS), the source operand must be a valid segment selector. In protected mode, moving a segment selector into a segment register automatically causes the segment descriptor information associated with that segment selector to be loaded into the hidden (shadow) part of the segment register. While loading this information, the segment selector and segment descriptor information is validated (see the “Operation” algorithm below). The segment descriptor data is obtained from the GDT or LDT entry for the specified segment selector.\nA NULL segment selector (values 0000-0003) can be loaded into the DS, ES, FS, and GS registers without causing a protection exception. However, any subsequent attempt to reference a segment whose corresponding segment register is loaded with a NULL value causes a general protection exception (#GP) and no memory reference occurs.\nLoading the SS register with a MOV instruction inhibits all interrupts until after the execution of the next instruc-tion. This operation allows a stack pointer to be loaded into the ESP register with the next instruction (MOV ESP, stack-pointer value) before an interrupt occurs1. Be aware that the LSS instruction offers a more efficient method of loading the SS and ESP registers.\nWhen operating in 32-bit mode and moving data between a segment register and a general-purpose register, the 32-bit IA-32 processors do not require the use of the 16-bit operand-size prefix (a byte with the value 66H) with\n1.\nIf a code instruction breakpoint (for debug) is placed on an instruction located immediately after a MOV SS instruction, the break-point may not be triggered. However, in a sequence of instructions that load the SS register, only the first instruction in the sequence is guaranteed to delay an interrupt.\nIn the following sequence, interrupts may be recognized before MOV ESP, EBP executes:\nMOV SS, EDX MOV SS, EAX MOV ESP, EBP\nthis instruction, but most assemblers will insert it if the standard form of the instruction is used (for example, MOV DS, AX). The processor will execute this instruction correctly, but it will usually require an extra clock. With most assemblers, using the instruction form MOV DS, EAX will avoid this unneeded 66H prefix. When the processor executes the instruction with a 32-bit general-purpose register, it assumes that the 16 least-significant bits of the general-purpose register are the destination or source operand. If the register is a destination operand, the resulting value in the two high-order bytes of the register is implementation dependent. For the Pentium 4, Intel Xeon, and P6 family processors, the two high-order bytes are filled with zeros; for earlier 32-bit IA-32 processors, the two high order bytes are undefined.\nIn 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permits access to addi-tional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits.

    "Description": "\n(V)MOVNTDQA loads a double quadword from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand) using a non-temporal hint. A processor implementation may make use of the non-temporal hint associated with this instruction if the memory source is WC (write combining) memory type. An implementation may also make use of the non-temporal hint associated with this instruction if the memory source is WB (write back) memory type.\nA processor’s implementation of the non-temporal hint does not override the effective memory type semantics, but the implementation of the hint is processor dependent. For example, a processor implementation may choose to ignore the hint and process the instruction as a normal MOVDQA for any memory type. Another implementation of the hint for WC memory type may optimize data transfer throughput of WC reads. A third implementation may optimize cache reads generated by (V)MOVNTDQA on WB memory type to reduce cache evictions.\nWC Streaming Load Hint\nFor WC memory type in particular, the processor never appears to read the data into the cache hierarchy. Instead, the non-temporal hint may be implemented by loading a temporary internal buffer with the equivalent of an aligned cache line without filling this data to the cache. Any memory-type aliased lines in the cache will be snooped and flushed. Subsequent MOVNTDQA reads to unread portions of the WC cache line will receive data from the temporary internal buffer if data is available. The temporary internal buffer may be flushed by the processor at any time for any reason, for example:\nThe memory type of the region being read can override the non-temporal hint, if the memory address specified for the non-temporal read is not a WC memory region. Information on non-temporal reads and writes can be found in Chapter 11, “Memory Cache Control” of Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A.\nBecause the WC protocol uses a weakly-ordered memory consistency model, an MFENCE or locked instruction should be used in conjunction with MOVNTDQA instructions if multiple processors might reference the same WC memory locations or in order to synchronize reads of a processor with writes by other agents in the system. Because of the speculative nature of fetching due to MOVNTDQA, Streaming loads must not be used to reference memory addresses that are mapped to I/O devices having side effects or when reads to these devices are destruc-\ntive.

Both the source and destination operands are located in memory. The address of the source operand is read from the DS:ESI or the DS:SI registers (depending on the address-size attri-bute of the instruction, 32 or 16, respectively). The address of the destination operand is read from the ES:EDI or the ES:DI registers (again depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction). The DS segment may be overridden with a segment override prefix, but the ES segment cannot be overridden.\nAt the assembly-code level, two forms of this instruction are allowed: the “explicit-operands” form and the “no-operands” form. The explicit-operands form (specified with the MOVS mnemonic) allows the source and destination operands to be specified explicitly. Here, the source and destination operands should be symbols that indicate the size and location of the source value and the destination, respectively. This explicit-operands form is provided to allow documentation; however, note that the documentation provided by this form can be misleading. That is, the source and destination operand symbols must specify the correct type (size) of the operands (bytes, words, or doublewords), but they do not have to specify the correct location. The locations of the source and destination operands are always specified by the DS:(E)SI and ES:(E)DI registers, which must be loaded correctly before the move string instruction is executed.\nThe no-operands form provides “short forms” of the byte, word, and doubleword versions of the MOVS instruc-tions. Here also DS:(E)SI and ES:(E)DI are assumed to be the source and destination operands, respectively. The size of the source and destination operands is selected with the mnemonic: MOVSB (byte move), MOVSW (word move), or MOVSD (doubleword move).\nAfter the move operation, the (E)SI and (E)DI registers are incremented or decremented automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. (If the DF flag is 0, the (E)SI and (E)DI register are incre-\nmented; if the DF flag is 1, the (E)SI and (E)DI registers are decremented.) The registers are incremented or decremented by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word operations, or by 4 for doubleword operations.\nNOTE\nTo improve performance, more recent processors support modifications to the processor’s operation during the string store operations initiated with MOVS and MOVSB. See Section 7.3.9.3 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 for additional information on fast-string operation.\nThe MOVS, MOVSB, MOVSW, and MOVSD instructions can be preceded by the REP prefix (see “REP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ—Repeat String Operation Prefix” in Chapter 4 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 2B, for a description of the REP prefix) for block moves of ECX bytes, words, or doublewords.\nIn 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default address size is 64 bits, 32-bit address size is supported using the prefix 67H. The 64-bit addresses are specified by RSI and RDI; 32-bit address are specified by ESI and EDI. Use of the REX.W prefix promotes doubleword operation to 64 bits.

Packed SAD word results are calculated within each 128-bit lane. Each SAD word result is calculated between a stationary block_2 (whose offset within the second source operand is selected by a two bit select control, multiplied by 32 bits) and a sliding block_1 at consecutive byte-granular position within the first source operand. The offset of the first 32-bit block of block_1 is selectable using a one bit select control, multiplied by 32 bits.\n128-bit Legacy SSE version: Imm8[1:0]*32 specifies the bit offset of block_2 within the second source operand. Imm[2]*32 specifies the initial bit offset of the block_1 within the first source operand. The first source operand and destination operand are the same. The first source and destination operands are XMM registers. The second source operand is either an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. Bits (VLMAX-1:128) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged.

Bits 7:3 of the immediate byte are ignored.\nVEX.256 encoded version: The sum-absolute-difference (SAD) operation is repeated 8 times for MPSADW between the same block_2 (fixed offset within the second source operand) and a variable block_1 (offset is shifted by 8 bits for each SAD operation) in the first source operand. Each 16-bit result of eight SAD operations between block_2 and block_1 is written to the respective word in the lower 128 bits of the destination operand.\nAdditionally, VMPSADBW performs another eight SAD operations on block_4 of the second source operand and block_3 of the first source operand.

    "Description": "\nCopies data from the source operand (second operand) to the I/O port specified with the destination operand (first operand). The source operand is a memory location, the address of which is read from either the DS:SI, DS:ESI or the RSI registers (depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction, 16, 32 or 64, respectively). (The DS segment may be overridden with a segment override prefix.) The destination operand is an I/O port address (from 0 to 65,535) that is read from the DX register. The size of the I/O port being accessed (that is, the size of the source and destination operands) is determined by the opcode for an 8-bit I/O port or by the operand-size attribute of the instruction for a 16- or 32-bit I/O port.\nAt the assembly-code level, two forms of this instruction are allowed: the “explicit-operands” form and the “no-operands” form. The explicit-operands form (specified with the OUTS mnemonic) allows the source and destination operands to be specified explicitly. Here, the source operand should be a symbol that indicates the size of the I/O port and the source address, and the destination operand must be DX. This explicit-operands form is provided to allow documentation; however, note that the documentation provided by this form can be misleading. That is, the source operand symbol must specify the correct type (size) of the operand (byte, word, or doubleword), but it does not have to specify the correct location. The location is always specified by the DS:(E)SI or RSI registers, which must be loaded correctly before the OUTS instruction is executed.\nThe no-operands form provides “short forms” of the byte, word, and doubleword versions of the OUTS instructions. Here also DS:(E)SI is assumed to be the source operand and DX is assumed to be the destination operand. The size of the I/O port is specified with the choice of mnemonic: OUTSB (byte), OUTSW (word), or OUTSD (doubleword).\nAfter the byte, word, or doubleword is transferred from the memory location to the I/O port, the SI/ESI/RSI register is incremented or decremented automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. (If the DF flag is 0, the (E)SI register is incremented; if the DF flag is 1, the SI/ESI/RSI register is decremented.) The SI/ESI/RSI register is incremented or decremented by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word operations, and by 4 for doubleword operations.\nThe OUTS, OUTSB, OUTSW, and OUTSD instructions can be preceded by the REP prefix for block input of ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. See “REP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ—Repeat String Operation Prefix” in this chapter for a description of the REP prefix. This instruction is only useful for accessing I/O ports located in the processor’s I/O address space. See Chapter 16, “Input/Output,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for more information on accessing I/O ports in the I/O address space.\nIn 64-bit mode, the default operand size is 32 bits; operand size is not promoted by the use of REX.W. In 64-bit mode, the default address size is 64 bits, and 64-bit address is specified using RSI by default. 32-bit address using ESI is support using the prefix 67H, but 16-bit address is not supported in 64-bit mode.\n"

    "Brief": "Spin Loop Hint",
    "Description": "\nImproves the performance of spin-wait loops. When executing a “spin-wait loop,” processors will suffer a severe performance penalty when exiting the loop because it detects a possible memory order violation. The PAUSE instruction provides a hint to the processor that the code sequence is a spin-wait loop. The processor uses this hint to avoid the memory order violation in most situations, which greatly improves processor performance. For this reason, it is recommended that a PAUSE instruction be placed in all spin-wait loops.\nAn additional function of the PAUSE instruction is to reduce the power consumed by a processor while executing a spin loop. A processor can execute a spin-wait loop extremely quickly, causing the processor to consume a lot of power while it waits for the resource it is spinning on to become available. Inserting a pause instruction in a spin-wait loop greatly reduces the processor’s power consumption.\nThis instruction was introduced in the Pentium 4 processors, but is backward compatible with all IA-32 processors. In earlier IA-32 processors, the PAUSE instruction operates like a NOP instruction. The Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors implement the PAUSE instruction as a delay. The delay is finite and can be zero for some processors. This instruction does not change the architectural state of the processor (that is, it performs essentially a delaying no-op operation).\nThis instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.\n"

    "Description": "\nLoads the value from the top of the stack to the location specified with the destination operand (or explicit opcode) and then increments the stack pointer. The destination operand can be a general-purpose register, memory loca-tion, or segment register.\nAddress and operand sizes are determined and used as follows:\nThe address size is used only when writing to a destination operand in memory.\nThe operand size (16, 32, or 64 bits) determines the amount by which the stack pointer is incremented (2, 4 or 8).\nThe stack-address size determines the width of the stack pointer when reading from the stack in memory and when incrementing the stack pointer. (As stated above, the amount by which the stack pointer is incremented is determined by the operand size.)\nIf the destination operand is one of the segment registers DS, ES, FS, GS, or SS, the value loaded into the register must be a valid segment selector. In protected mode, popping a segment selector into a segment register automat-ically causes the descriptor information associated with that segment selector to be loaded into the hidden (shadow) part of the segment register and causes the selector and the descriptor information to be validated (see the “Operation” section below).\nA NULL value (0000-0003) may be popped into the DS, ES, FS, or GS register without causing a general protection fault. However, any subsequent attempt to reference a segment whose corresponding segment register is loaded with a NULL value causes a general protection exception (#GP). In this situation, no memory reference occurs and the saved value of the segment register is NULL.\nThe POP instruction cannot pop a value into the CS register. To load the CS register from the stack, use the RET instruction.\nIf the ESP register is used as a base register for addressing a destination operand in memory, the POP instruction computes the effective address of the operand after it increments the ESP register. For the case of a 16-bit stack where ESP wraps to 0H as a result of the POP instruction, the resulting location of the memory write is processor-family-specific.\nThe POP ESP instruction increments the stack pointer (ESP) before data at the old top of stack is written into the destination.\nA POP SS instruction inhibits all interrupts, including the NMI interrupt, until after execution of the next instruction. This action allows sequential execution of POP SS and MOV ESP, EBP instructions without the danger of having an invalid stack during an interrupt1. However, use of the LSS instruction is the preferred method of loading the SS and ESP registers.\nIn 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). When in 64-bit mode, POPs using 32-bit operands are not encodable and POPs to DS, ES, SS are not valid. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.\n"

These instructions reverse the operation of the PUSHF/PUSHFD instructions.\nThe POPF (pop flags) and POPFD (pop flags double) mnemonics reference the same opcode. The POPF instruction is intended for use when the operand-size attribute is 16; the POPFD instruction is intended for use when the operand-size attribute is 32. Some assemblers may force the operand size to 16 for POPF and to 32 for POPFD. Others may treat the mnemonics as synonyms (POPF/POPFD) and use the setting of the operand-size attribute to determine the size of values to pop from the stack.\nThe effect of POPF/POPFD on the EFLAGS register changes, depending on the mode of operation. See the Table 4-12 and key below for details.\nWhen operating in protected, compatibility, or 64-bit mode at privilege level 0 (or in real-address mode, the equiv-alent to privilege level 0), all non-reserved flags in the EFLAGS register except RF1, VIP, VIF, and VM may be modi-fied. VIP, VIF and VM remain unaffected.\nWhen operating in protected, compatibility, or 64-bit mode with a privilege level greater than 0, but less than or equal to IOPL, all flags can be modified except the IOPL field and RF1, IF, VIP, VIF, and VM; these remain unaf-fected. The AC and ID flags can only be modified if the operand-size attribute is 32. The interrupt flag (IF) is altered only when executing at a level at least as privileged as the IOPL. If a POPF/POPFD instruction is executed with insufficient privilege, an exception does not occur but privileged bits do not change.\nWhen operating in virtual-8086 mode (EFLAGS.VM = 1) without the virtual-8086 mode extensions (CR4.VME = 0), the POPF/POPFD instructions can be used only if IOPL = 3; otherwise, a general-protection exception (#GP) occurs. If the virtual-8086 mode extensions are enabled (CR4.VME = 1), POPF (but not POPFD) can be executed in virtual-8086 mode with IOPL &lt; 3.\nIn 64-bit mode, use REX.W to pop the top of stack to RFLAGS. The mnemonic assigned is POPFQ (note that the 32-bit operand is not encodable).

Here, if the source operand contains all 0s, the result (stored in the destination operand) contains zero extensions of the high-order data elements from the original value in the destination operand. For example, with the (V)PUNPCKLBW instruction the high-order bytes are zero extended (that is, unpacked into unsigned word integers), and with the (V)PUNPCKLWD instruction, the high-order words are zero extended (unpacked into unsigned doubleword integers).\nIn 64-bit mode, using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).\nLegacy SSE versions: The source operand can be an MMX technology register or a 32-bit memory location.

If  the  source  operand  is  a  segment  register  (16  bits)  and  the  operand  size  is  64-bits,  a  zero-extended value is pushed on the stack; if the operand size is 32-bits, either a zero-extended value is pushed on the stack or the segment selector is written on the stack using a 16-bit move. For the last case, all recent Core and Atom processors perform a 16-bit move, leaving the upper portion of the stack location unmodified.\nThe stack-address size determines the width of the stack pointer when writing to the stack in memory and when  decrementing\nthe  stack  pointer.

If a PUSH instruction uses a memory operand in which the ESP register is used for computing the operand address, the address of the operand is computed before the ESP register is decremented.\nIf the ESP or SP register is 1 when the PUSH instruction is executed in real-address mode, a stack-fault exception (#SS) is generated (because the limit of the stack segment is violated). Its delivery encounters a second stack-fault exception (for the same reason), causing generation of a double-fault exception (#DF). Delivery of the double-fault exception encounters a third stack-fault exception, and the logical processor enters shutdown mode.

A 32-bit read executes faster on Pentium 4 processors and Intel Xeon processors than a full 40-bit read.\nOn 64-bit Intel Xeon processors with L3, performance counters with indices 18-25 are 32-bit counters.

When the PCE flag is set, the RDPMC instruction can be executed at any privilege level; when the flag is clear, the instruction can only be executed at privilege level 0. (When in real-address mode, the RDPMC instruction is always enabled.)\nThe performance-monitoring counters can also be read with the RDMSR instruction, when executing at privilege level 0.\nThe performance-monitoring counters are event counters that can be programmed to count events such as the number of instructions decoded, number of interrupts received, or number of cache loads. Chapter 19, “Perfor-mance Monitoring Events,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3B, lists the events that can be counted for various processors in the Intel 64 and IA-32 architecture families.\nThe RDPMC instruction is not a serializing instruction; that is, it does not imply that all the events caused by the preceding instructions have been completed or that events caused by subsequent instructions have not begun. If an exact event count is desired, software must insert a serializing instruction (such as the CPUID instruction) before and/or after the RDPMC instruction.\nIn the Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors, performing back-to-back fast reads are not guaranteed to be mono-tonic. To guarantee monotonicity on back-to-back reads, a serializing instruction must be placed between the two RDPMC instructions.\nThe RDPMC instruction can execute in 16-bit addressing mode or virtual-8086 mode; however, the full contents of the ECX register are used to select the counter, and the event count is stored in the full EAX and EDX registers. The RDPMC instruction was introduced into the IA-32 Architecture in the Pentium Pro processor and the Pentium processor with MMX technology. The earlier Pentium processors have performance-monitoring counters, but they must be read with the RDMSR instruction.\n"

Software must check the state of CF=1 for determining if a valid random seed value has been returned, otherwise it is expected to loop and retry execution of RDSEED (see Section 1.2).\nThe RDSEED instruction is available at all privilege levels. The RDSEED instruction executes normally either inside or outside a transaction region.\nIn 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.B permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bit oper-ands.

    "Description": "\nRepeats a string instruction the number of times specified in the count register or until the indicated condition of the ZF flag is no longer met. The REP (repeat), REPE (repeat while equal), REPNE (repeat while not equal), REPZ (repeat while zero), and REPNZ (repeat while not zero) mnemonics are prefixes that can be added to one of the string instructions. The REP prefix can be added to the INS, OUTS, MOVS, LODS, and STOS instructions, and the REPE, REPNE, REPZ, and REPNZ prefixes can be added to the CMPS and SCAS instructions. (The REPZ and REPNZ prefixes are synonymous forms of the REPE and REPNE prefixes, respectively.) The F3H prefix is defined for the following instructions and undefined for the rest:\nThe REP prefixes apply only to one string instruction at a time. To repeat a block of instructions, use the LOOP instruction or another looping construct. All of these repeat prefixes cause the associated instruction to be repeated until the count in register is decremented to 0. See Table 4-14.\nTable 4-14.  Repeat Prefixes\n\n\nRepeat Prefix\nTermination Condition 1*\nTermination Condition 2\n\n\nREP\nREPE/REPZ\nREPNE/REPNZ\n\nRCX or (E)CX = 0\nRCX or (E)CX = 0\nRCX or (E)CX = 0\n\nNone\nZF = 0\nZF = 1\nNOTES:\n*\nCount register is CX, ECX or RCX by default, depending on attributes of the operating modes.\nThe REPE, REPNE, REPZ, and REPNZ prefixes also check the state of the ZF flag after each iteration and terminate the repeat loop if the ZF flag is not in the specified state. When both termination conditions are tested, the cause of a repeat termination can be determined either by testing the count register with a JECXZ instruction or by testing the ZF flag (with a JZ, JNZ, or JNE instruction).\nWhen the REPE/REPZ and REPNE/REPNZ prefixes are used, the ZF flag does not require initialization because both the CMPS and SCAS instructions affect the ZF flag according to the results of the comparisons they make.\nA repeating string operation can be suspended by an exception or interrupt. When this happens, the state of the registers is preserved to allow the string operation to be resumed upon a return from the exception or interrupt handler. The source and destination registers point to the next string elements to be operated on, the EIP register points to the string instruction, and the ECX register has the value it held following the last successful iteration of the instruction. This mechanism allows long string operations to proceed without affecting the interrupt response time of the system.\nWhen a fault occurs during the execution of a CMPS or SCAS instruction that is prefixed with REPE or REPNE, the EFLAGS value is restored to the state prior to the execution of the instruction. Since the SCAS and CMPS instruc-tions do not use EFLAGS as an input, the processor can resume the instruction after the page fault handler.\nUse the REP INS and REP OUTS instructions with caution. Not all I/O ports can handle the rate at which these instructions execute. Note that a REP STOS instruction is the fastest way to initialize a large block of memory.\nIn 64-bit mode, the operand size of the count register is associated with the address size attribute. Thus the default count register is RCX; REX.W has no effect on the address size and the count register. In 64-bit mode, if 67H is used to override address size attribute, the count register is ECX and any implicit source/destination operand will use the corresponding 32-bit index register.

The address is usually placed on the stack by a CALL instruction, and the return is made to the instruction that follows the CALL instruction.\nThe optional source operand specifies the number of stack bytes to be released after the return address is popped; the default is none. This operand can be used to release parameters from the stack that were passed to the called procedure and are no longer needed. It must be used when the CALL instruction used to switch to a new procedure uses a call gate with a non-zero word count to access the new procedure. Here, the source operand for the RET instruction must specify the same number of bytes as is specified in the word count field of the call gate.\nThe RET instruction can be used to execute three different types of returns:\nThe inter-privilege-level return type can only be executed in protected mode. See the section titled “Calling Proce-dures Using Call and RET” in Chapter 6 of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, for detailed information on near, far, and inter-privilege-level returns.\nWhen executing a near return, the processor pops the return instruction pointer (offset) from the top of the stack into the EIP register and begins program execution at the new instruction pointer. The CS register is unchanged.\nWhen executing a far return, the processor pops the return instruction pointer from the top of the stack into the EIP register, then pops the segment selector from the top of the stack into the CS register. The processor then begins program execution in the new code segment at the new instruction pointer.\nThe mechanics of an inter-privilege-level far return are similar to an intersegment return, except that the processor examines the privilege levels and access rights of the code and stack segments being returned to deter-mine if the control transfer is allowed to be made. The DS, ES, FS, and GS segment registers are cleared by the RET instruction during an inter-privilege-level return if they refer to segments that are not allowed to be accessed at the new privilege level. Since a stack switch also occurs on an inter-privilege level return, the ESP and SS registers are loaded from the stack.\nIf parameters are passed to the called procedure during an inter-privilege level call, the optional source operand must be used with the RET instruction to release the parameters on the return. Here, the parameters are released both from the called procedure’s stack and the calling procedure’s stack (that is, the stack being returned to).\nIn 64-bit mode, the default operation size of this instruction is the stack-address size, i.e. 64 bits. This applies to near returns, not far returns; the default operation size of far returns is 32 bits.\n"

Bits shifted beyond the destination operand boundary are first shifted into the CF flag, then discarded. At the end of the shift operation, the CF flag contains the last bit shifted out of the destination operand.\nThe destination operand can be a register or a memory location. The count operand can be an immediate value or the CL register. The count is masked to 5 bits (or 6 bits if in 64-bit mode and REX.W is used). The count range is limited to 0 to 31 (or 63 if 64-bit mode and REX.W is used). A special opcode encoding is provided for a count of 1.\nThe shift arithmetic left (SAL) and shift logical left (SHL) instructions perform the same operation; they shift the bits in the destination operand to the left (toward more significant bit locations). For each shift count, the most significant bit of the destination operand is shifted into the CF flag, and the least significant bit is cleared (see Figure 7-7 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1).\nThe shift arithmetic right (SAR) and shift logical right (SHR) instructions shift the bits of the destination operand to the right (toward less significant bit locations). For each shift count, the least significant bit of the destination operand is shifted into the CF flag, and the most significant bit is either set or cleared depending on the instruction type. The SHR instruction clears the most significant bit (see Figure 7-8 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1); the SAR instruction sets or clears the most significant bit to correspond to the sign (most significant bit) of the original value in the destination operand. In effect, the SAR instruction fills the empty bit position’s shifted value with the sign of the unshifted value (see Figure 7-9 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1).\nThe SAR and SHR instructions can be used to perform signed or unsigned division, respectively, of the destination operand by powers of 2. For example, using the SAR instruction to shift a signed integer 1 bit to the right divides the value by 2.\nUsing the SAR instruction to perform a division operation does not produce the same result as the IDIV instruction. The quotient from the IDIV instruction is rounded toward zero, whereas the “quotient” of the SAR instruction is rounded toward negative infinity. This difference is apparent only for negative numbers. For example, when the IDIV instruction is used to divide -9 by 4, the result is -2 with a remainder of -1. If the SAR instruction is used to shift -9 right by two bits, the result is -3 and the “remainder” is +3; however, the SAR instruction stores only the most significant bit of the remainder (in the CF flag).\nThe OF flag is affected only on 1-bit shifts. For left shifts, the OF flag is set to 0 if the most-significant bit of the result is the same as the CF flag (that is, the top two bits of the original operand were the same); otherwise, it is set to 1. For the SAR instruction, the OF flag is cleared for all 1-bit shifts. For the SHR instruction, the OF flag is set to the most-significant bit of the original operand.\nIn 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits and the mask width for CL is 5 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64-bits and sets the mask width for CL to 6 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.\n"

Instead, the processor evaluates the result for both data types and sets the OF and CF flags to indicate a borrow in the signed or unsigned result, respectively. The SF flag indicates the sign of the signed result.\nThe SBB instruction is usually executed as part of a multibyte or multiword subtraction in which a SUB instruction is followed by a SBB instruction.\nThis instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.\nIn 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits.

    "Description": "\nIn non-64-bit modes and in default 64-bit mode: this instruction compares a byte, word, doubleword or quadword specified using a memory operand with the value in AL, AX, or EAX. It then sets status flags in EFLAGS recording the results. The memory operand address is read from ES:(E)DI register (depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction and the current operational mode). Note that ES cannot be overridden with a segment override prefix.\nAt the assembly-code level, two forms of this instruction are allowed. The explicit-operand form and the no-oper-ands form. The explicit-operand form (specified using the SCAS mnemonic) allows a memory operand to be speci-fied explicitly. The memory operand must be a symbol that indicates the size and location of the operand value. The register operand is then automatically selected to match the size of the memory operand (AL register for byte comparisons, AX for word comparisons, EAX for doubleword comparisons). The explicit-operand form is provided to allow documentation. Note that the documentation provided by this form can be misleading. That is, the memory operand symbol must specify the correct type (size) of the operand (byte, word, or doubleword) but it does not have to specify the correct location. The location is always specified by ES:(E)DI.\nThe no-operands form of the instruction uses a short form of SCAS. Again, ES:(E)DI is assumed to be the memory operand and AL, AX, or EAX is assumed to be the register operand. The size of operands is selected by the mnemonic: SCASB (byte comparison), SCASW (word comparison), or SCASD (doubleword comparison).\nAfter the comparison, the (E)DI register is incremented or decremented automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. If the DF flag is 0, the (E)DI register is incremented; if the DF flag is 1, the (E)DI register is decremented. The register is incremented or decremented by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word oper-ations, and by 4 for doubleword operations.\nSCAS, SCASB, SCASW, SCASD, and SCASQ can be preceded by the REP prefix for block comparisons of ECX bytes, words, doublewords, or quadwords. Often, however, these instructions will be used in a LOOP construct that takes\nsome action based on the setting of status flags. See “REP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ—Repeat String Operation Prefix” in this chapter for a description of the REP prefix.\nIn 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default address size is 64-bits, 32-bit address size is supported using the prefix 67H. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation on doubleword operand to 64 bits. The 64-bit no-operand mnemonic is SCASQ. Address of the memory operand is specified in either RDI or EDI, and AL/AX/EAX/RAX may be used as the register operand. After a comparison, the destination register is incremented or decremented by the current operand size (depending on the value of the DF flag).

The destination operand points to a byte register or a byte in memory. The condition code suffix (cc) indicates the condition being tested for.\nThe terms “above” and “below” are associated with the CF flag and refer to the relationship between two unsigned integer values. The terms “greater” and “less” are associated with the SF and OF flags and refer to the relationship between two signed integer values.\nMany of the SETcc instruction opcodes have alternate mnemonics. For example, SETG (set byte if greater) and SETNLE (set if not less or equal) have the same opcode and test for the same condition: ZF equals 0 and SF equals OF. These alternate mnemonics are provided to make code more intelligible. Appendix B, “EFLAGS Condition Codes,” in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1, shows the alternate mnemonics for various test conditions.\nSome languages represent a logical one as an integer with all bits set. This representation can be obtained by choosing the logically opposite condition for the SETcc instruction, then decrementing the result. For example, to test for overflow, use the SETNO instruction, then decrement the result.\nIn IA-64 mode, the operand size is fixed at 8 bits. Use of REX prefix enable uniform addressing to additional byte registers. Otherwise, this instruction’s operation is the same as in legacy mode and compatibility mode.\n"

The SFENCE instruction is ordered with respect to store instructions, other SFENCE instructions, any LFENCE and MFENCE instructions, and any serializing instructions (such as the CPUID instruction). It is not ordered with respect to load instructions.\nWeakly ordered memory types can be used to achieve higher processor performance through such techniques as out-of-order issue, write-combining, and write-collapsing. The degree to which a consumer of data recognizes or knows that the data is weakly ordered varies among applications and may be unknown to the producer of this data. The SFENCE instruction provides a performance-efficient way of ensuring store ordering between routines that produce weakly-ordered results and routines that consume this data.\nThis instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.\nSpecification of the instruction's opcode above indicates a ModR/M byte of F8. For this instruction, the processor ignores the r/m field of the ModR/M byte. Thus, SFENCE is encoded by any opcode of the form 0F AE Fx, where x is in the range 8-F.\n"

    "Description": "\nIn non-64-bit and default 64-bit mode; stores a byte, word, or doubleword from the AL, AX, or EAX register (respectively) into the destination operand. The destination operand is a memory location, the address of which is read from either the ES:EDI or ES:DI register (depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction and the mode of operation). The ES segment cannot be overridden with a segment override prefix.\nAt the assembly-code level, two forms of the instruction are allowed: the “explicit-operands” form and the “no-operands” form. The explicit-operands form (specified with the STOS mnemonic) allows the destination operand to be specified explicitly. Here, the destination operand should be a symbol that indicates the size and location of the destination value. The source operand is then automatically selected to match the size of the destination operand (the AL register for byte operands, AX for word operands, EAX for doubleword operands). The explicit-operands form is provided to allow documentation; however, note that the documentation provided by this form can be misleading. That is, the destination operand symbol must specify the correct type (size) of the operand (byte, word, or doubleword), but it does not have to specify the correct location. The location is always specified by the ES:(E)DI register. These must be loaded correctly before the store string instruction is executed.\nThe no-operands form provides “short forms” of the byte, word, doubleword, and quadword versions of the STOS instructions. Here also ES:(E)DI is assumed to be the destination operand and AL, AX, or EAX is assumed to be the source operand. The size of the destination and source operands is selected by the mnemonic: STOSB (byte read from register AL), STOSW (word from AX), STOSD (doubleword from EAX).\nAfter the byte, word, or doubleword is transferred from the register to the memory location, the (E)DI register is incremented or decremented according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. If the DF flag is 0, the register is incremented; if the DF flag is 1, the register is decremented (the register is incremented or decremented by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word operations, by 4 for doubleword operations).\nNOTE\nTo improve performance, more recent processors support modifications to the processor’s operation during the string store operations initiated with STOS and STOSB. See Section 7.3.9.3 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1 for additional information on fast-string operation.\nIn 64-bit mode, the default address size is 64 bits, 32-bit address size is supported using the prefix 67H. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation on doubleword operand to 64 bits. The promoted no-operand mnemonic is STOSQ. STOSQ (and its explicit operands variant) store a quadword from the RAX register into the destination addressed by RDI or EDI. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits.\nThe STOS, STOSB, STOSW, STOSD, STOSQ instructions can be preceded by the REP prefix for block loads of ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. More often, however, these instructions are used within a LOOP construct because data needs to be moved into the AL, AX, or EAX register before it can be stored. See “REP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ—Repeat String Operation Prefix” in this chapter for a description of the REP prefix.\n"

Thus, the kernel cannot save general purpose registers or reference memory.\nBy design, SWAPGS does not require any general purpose registers or memory operands. No registers need to be saved before using the instruction. SWAPGS exchanges the CPL 0 data pointer from the IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE MSR with the GS base register. The kernel can then use the GS prefix on normal memory references to access kernel data structures. Similarly, when the OS kernel is entered using an interrupt or exception (where the kernel stack is already set up), SWAPGS can be used to quickly get a pointer to the kernel data structures.\nThe IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE MSR itself is only accessible using RDMSR/WRMSR instructions.

    "Description": "\nWrites the contents of registers EDX:EAX into the 64-bit extended control register (XCR) specified in the ECX register. (On processors that support the Intel 64 architecture, the high-order 32 bits of RCX are ignored.) The contents of the EDX register are copied to high-order 32 bits of the selected XCR and the contents of the EAX register are copied to low-order 32 bits of the XCR. (On processors that support the Intel 64 architecture, the high-order 32 bits of each of RAX and RDX are ignored.) Undefined or reserved bits in an XCR should be set to values previously read.\nThis instruction must be executed at privilege level 0 or in real-address mode; otherwise, a general protection exception #GP(0) is generated. Specifying a reserved or unimplemented XCR in ECX will also cause a general protection exception. The processor will also generate a general protection exception if software attempts to write to reserved bits in an XCR.\nCurrently, only XCR0 is supported. Thus, all other values of ECX are reserved and will cause a #GP(0). Note that bit 0 of XCR0 (corresponding to x87 state) must be set to 1; the instruction will cause a #GP(0) if an attempt is made to clear this bit. In addition, the instruction causes a #GP(0) if an attempt is made to set XCR0[2] (AVX state) while clearing XCR0[1] (SSE state); it is necessary to set both bits to use AVX instructions; Section 13.3, “Enabling the XSAVE Feature Set and XSAVE-Supported Features,” of Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 1.\n"
